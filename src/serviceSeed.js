      description:
        "Replacing tires is crucial for maintaining vehicle safety, handling, and performance. Worn-out tires can reduce traction, increase stopping distances, and lead to poor handling, especially in wet or slippery conditions. Tire replacement is generally recommended when the tread depth reaches 2/32 of an inch or if the tires show signs of damage such as cracks or punctures. Tire replacement intervals vary based on driving conditions, tire type, and vehicle usage, but on average, tires should be replaced every 25,000 to 50,000 miles.",

        "Replacing the vehicle's battery is essential for ensuring reliable engine starts and proper functioning of electrical components. Battery life can vary based on factors such as driving habits, climate, and the age of the battery. Typically, itâ€™s recommended to replace the battery every 3 to 5 years, but performance issues like slow starts or dimming lights may indicate it's time to replace it sooner.",
